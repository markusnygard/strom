//! RTMP output block.
//!
//! Publishes a programme to an RTMP server, muxed as FLV.
//!
//! Chain, built dynamically once the input caps are known:
//! - video: `h264parse` → `flvmux`
//! - audio, raw in: `audioconvert` → `audioresample` → `avenc_aac` → `aacparse` → `flvmux`
//! - audio, AAC in: `aacparse` → `flvmux`
//!
//! and `flvmux` → `rtmp2sink`.
//!
//! # Why the chains are built on caps rather than statically
//!
//! Two reasons, and the second is the one that bites.
//!
//! FLV carries a small closed set of codecs, so the muxer needs H.264 and AAC
//! whatever arrives. Both forms therefore have to be accepted on the audio pad:
//! raw is encoded here, AAC is parsed only.
//!
//! **Raw is encoded in the block, even though `builtin.audioenc` exists.** That
//! block encodes raw audio to AAC, Opus, MP3 or AC-3, so it is a real route to
//! this one and the supported one when the bitrate, sample rate or channel count
//! matter: put it in front, leave its codec on `aac`, and this block takes the
//! parse-only path. It is not made mandatory, because `builtin.mixer` outputs
//! raw audio and the common case is a mixed programme going straight out. The
//! three other output blocks that speak a muxed container,
//! `builtin.mpegtssrt_output`, `builtin.whip_output` and
//! `builtin.efpsrt_output`, all encode raw audio internally for the same reason,
//! and an output that refused raw would be the odd one out.
//!
//! Audio is deliberately asymmetric with video for that reason rather than by
//! omission, and the asymmetry is in the defaults, not in what is possible: an
//! H.264 encoder has a bitrate and a profile an operator has to choose, so
//! `builtin.videoenc` is required and raw video is refused; an AAC encoder at
//! 128 kbps is a reasonable default nobody needs to see. Encoded audio that is
//! not AAC is refused with a message naming `builtin.audioenc`, since FLV cannot
//! carry it whatever produced it.
//!
//! # Why the pads are reserved before the pipeline starts, not from the probes
//!
//! An aggregator's sink pad that never carries data means `flvmux` never
//! aggregates and nothing reaches the sink, so a pad must not exist for an input
//! that will not be fed. The obvious conclusion is to request each pad from its
//! caps probe, once the input has proved it has data. **That is wrong for FLV,
//! and it fails silently.**
//!
//! `flvmux` writes the FLV header and its `onMetaData` script tag at its first
//! aggregation. A pad requested after that is granted, and its buffers are muxed
//! into the body, but the stream is never declared in the header. Measured on
//! GStreamer 1.28.6 with this block's exact topology: pads requested from the
//! probes gave `hasAudio=False hasVideo=True` with 128 audio tags in the body,
//! and pads reserved before `PLAYING` gave `hasAudio=True hasVideo=True`. A
//! player that configures its decoders from the header, which is the normal
//! thing to do, plays no sound from the first case, and it reads as an encoder or
//! network fault rather than a graph mistake.
//!
//! `builtin.mpegtssrt_output` can request late because `mpegtsmux` re-emits PAT
//! and PMT continuously, so a late pad still gets announced. FLV's header is
//! written once, so this block cannot copy that.
//!
//! So the pads are reserved in `ctx.register_element_setup`, the window after
//! construction has linked every block and before the pipeline leaves NULL,
//! which is the only point where connectivity is known and the muxer has not
//! started. `recorder.rs` documents the same race for `splitmuxsink` and reaches
//! the same conclusion. Unconnected inputs get no pad, which preserves
//! video-only and audio-only flows, and a connected input whose codec is then
//! refused hands its reserved pad back, so a refusal cannot stall the other
//! stream. The probes still choose and insert the parser or encoder chain; they
//! just link into a pad that already exists.
//!
//! # Transport security: rtmps, and what is deliberately not configurable
//!
//! `rtmps://` in the location is all that is needed. `rtmp2sink` sets its own
//! `scheme` from the URL, and its `tls-validation-flags` default to
//! `validate-all`, so the server's certificate chain and identity are both
//! checked. **This block exposes no way to weaken that**, on purpose: the only
//! thing such a switch buys is accepting a self-signed certificate, and the
//! cost is a property whose whole function is to turn off the check that makes
//! `rtmps` worth using. A deployment that needs an internal CA should trust it
//! at the host, which is where trust decisions belong.
//!
//! Both halves were measured on 2026-09-09 against a real TLS endpoint,
//! `stunnel` in front of an RTMP listener with a certificate from a private CA:
//! with validation left at its default the connection is refused with
//! "Unacceptable TLS certificate", and with a trusted certificate the same chain
//! delivered 3.0 s of H.264 and AAC through the tunnel. So the refusal is real
//! rather than a default nothing enforces.
//!
//! **A location that is not `rtmp://` or `rtmps://` is refused at build time.**
//! `rtmp2sink` accepts any string and re-serialises whatever it could parse, so
//! `"not-a-url"` silently becomes `"rtmp:/"`: a plaintext connection to nowhere,
//! with no error. When a stream key in a URL is the only thing protecting a
//! programme feed, a typo that quietly drops encryption is the failure worth
//! refusing, so `parse_rtmp_location` names what is wrong instead.
//!
//! **No secret in an RTMP URL reaches a log from this block, and there are three
//! of them.** `user:pass@`, the stream key in the last path segment, and any
//! token in a query string. The stream key is the one worth naming: for most
//! servers it is the whole authorisation, which is exactly why the section above
//! calls it the only thing protecting the feed, so logging it would contradict
//! that. All three are masked by `redact_location`, which everything logged here
//! goes through; the host and the application survive so a line can still be
//! attributed to an output.
//!
//! **"from this block" is load-bearing, and was measured rather than assumed.**
//! The API's flow-create handler logs the whole request body at `debug`, so a
//! `location` carrying a stream key is already in the log before this block is
//! ever built. Redacting here is still worth doing: these are the lines emitted
//! on every start, at `info`, which is the level a deployment actually runs at.
//! But it does not make the URL a secret, and a reader of this module should not
//! conclude that it does.
//!
//! `rtmp2sink` lifts `user:pass@` into its own `username` and `password`
//! properties, so reading the property back is safe. The string the operator
//! supplied is not, and that is the one a block naturally logs. **Note what is
//! not solved by any of this: the URL is stored with the flow**, in flow JSON
//! and in the UI, because `location` is an ordinary string property. Log
//! redaction is not encryption at rest.
//!
//! A plaintext `rtmp://` target that is not loopback also gets one warning at
//! build, because the key and the media both cross the network readable.
//!
//! # Video is expected to arrive encoded
//!
//! `builtin.videoenc` exposes encoded H.264 on an `encoded_out` pad, so the
//! operator has a block for it, and encoding video inside an output block would
//! hide a bitrate and profile choice that belongs in the graph. Raw video is
//! refused with a message naming that block. See the audio section above for why
//! the two sides differ.
