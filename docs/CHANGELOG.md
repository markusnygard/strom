## [0.6.5] - 2026-06-12

### Added
- Vision Mixer: ColorCorrect look — primary correction (brightness, contrast, gamma, saturation) plus white balance (temperature, tint) and hue rotation, computed in YCbCr; a strict superset of `glcolorbalance` for camera matching. Neutral at every default, so an untouched correction is an identity pass. (#639)

  - 14 parameterized looks (chroma key, blur, pixelate, vignette, VHS, CRT, thermal, …) per input or on the PGM master
  - 19 shader wipes and 11 master-FX takes; operator UI tiers production staples up front with novelty effects behind a MORE toggle
  - Master look and FX takes run on independent PGM slots — a take never evicts the look
  - Self-animating shaders (time uniform from buffer PTS): frame-accurate with zero per-frame CPU
- Vision Mixer: zone borders as compositor underlay pads, per-PiP layout presets (#625)

- Tests: vision mixer FX tests skip without a working GL context, event-driven sampling (#627)

### CI
- Route sccache through self-hosted MinIO (S3) cache, build without sccache when credentials are unavailable (#611, #623)
- Trim GHA cache footprint and split rust-cache keys; bump actions to Node 24 runtimes (#615, #613, #616)
