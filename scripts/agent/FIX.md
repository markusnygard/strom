# Turning an approved design into a PR

Read `PROTOCOL.md` first. This is the stage after a human answered a triage `Ask:`.

You never decide the design yourself, and you never merge.

A PR from you is only worth its review time if it is either **mechanically checkable** — a
test that fails without the fix and passes with it — or **honestly labelled as an unverified
proposal** with the exact experiment that would falsify it.

## Phase 1 — follow up on what you opened earlier

Do this first; it is cheap, and it is where most of the value of this stage accrues.

For every open PR authored by you:

1. Read its check runs (`gh pr checks <N>`). If both runs of the two-commit structure have
   concluded, edit the body to replace the pending evidence lines with the actual
   conclusions, quoting the failing line from the test-only run. Say explicitly that the red
   run is the proof the test guards the fix — a red check otherwise reads as a broken PR.
2. If commit 1 is red on the new test and commit 2 is green, **promote the PR from class B or
   C to class A**: change the verdict line, quote the failing line as evidence, switch
   `Refs #<N>` to `Fixes #<N>`, and drop a `[needs hardware]` title prefix if it was only
   ever waiting for CI. **That promotion is the point of this phase.**
3. If CI on the head commit is red for any other reason, fix it if the cause is in your own
   diff, or set the body's verdict to `BLOCKED` and say what you could not resolve.
4. If the PR is older than 14 days with no human comment, close it with a one-line comment
   saying it is being closed as an unverified proposal that went stale and that the issue
   remains open.

   **Exception — never close a PR that is only waiting for a dispatch.** For a
   platform-specific fix the only route to class A runs through a human asking for the
   platform build, and this stage may not fire one. Such a PR is `class=C`: instead of closing
   it, re-post the command as a comment and carry it in every run summary while the PR stays
   open. CI-configuration fixes are usually this shape — their whole guard *is* the dispatch
   log, not a Rust test.

## Phase 2 — pick at most one issue

Run the board report first:

    scripts/agent/board.sh

It is a report, not a gate. It tells you, per issue, who replied after the triage, what the
marker says, and whether an open PR already claims it — and it leaves the judgements to you.

**Three of its findings are binding**, because they are unambiguous and being wrong is
expensive:

1. An issue under `AWAITING A FIRST REPLY` has nothing to implement. The open question is the
   point of the triage stage, and a PR is an answer to it.
2. An issue under `REPLIED, BUT NOT BY SOMEONE WHO MAY DECIDE` is reported, never acted on.
3. An issue under `DECIDED BUT ALREADY CLAIMED` is not duplicated. If the named PR plainly
   does not implement it, say so in the summary rather than opening a second one.

Everything under `CANDIDATES` is yours to weigh. Pick at most one — oldest decision first
unless you can say why not — and **for every note the report prints against it, state your
reading in the PR body.** Specifically:

- If the reply carries no `/agent-fix` token, say whether you read it as a decision and quote
  the sentence you are relying on. A reply can be a deferral ("debug this first") or
  information rather than a go-ahead.
- If it names no option, say which design you understood it to choose. A human may choose
  something the triage never offered; that is normal and often the best answer.
- If the marker records a non-`LOCAL` radius or an excluded area, **re-assess both for the
  design actually chosen** rather than inheriting them. Those fields describe the options the
  triage proposed, and a human who picked a different design has invalidated them. Give your
  own assessment and your reasoning.

If you cannot honestly say a reply is a decision, treat the issue as still waiting and say so.
That, not a token check, is what keeps this stage from answering its own question.

Excluded areas — where a proposal is the wrong response and a maintainer decision or hardware
is the actual blocker: workspace dependencies, crate features and version floors; **breaking**
changes to the API or WebSocket contract (renaming or changing an existing `StromEvent`
variant, endpoint shape or config key); pipeline lifecycle, teardown and object references;
BUFFER probes.

*Additive* work is not excluded. CLAUDE.md requires new API-visible and shared types to live
in `strom-types`, so treating an added type, variant or block as excluded would rule out the
one placement the repo mandates. What is excluded is breaking or lifetime-critical surface. A
new endpoint still needs both `#[utoipa::path]` and its `openapi.rs` registration — that is a
repo rule to follow, not a gate to clear.

If nothing qualifies, open no PR. Say so in the summary and stop. **A quiet run is a correct
outcome and happens often.**

## Phase 3 — implement it, test first

Branch off current `main`, structured as exactly two commits:

    commit 1: the test alone, no implementation
    commit 2: the implementation

That order is not a style preference. It makes "this test guards this change" checkable by
anyone in ten seconds: check out commit 1, run the test, watch it fail. The exact branch name
and commit subjects depend on `work=` — see the table below.

### The vocabulary depends on `work=`, and most of the board is not `bug`

The two-commit evidence structure is the same for every shape of change. The words around it
are not, and using the `bug` words for additive work produces PRs that misdescribe
themselves — a real one shipped an `enhancement` on branch `agent/fix-691-…` titled
`fix(efpsrt): …` with a commit claiming to "reproduce" a defect that never existed.

Read `work=` from the triage marker and use the matching row:

| `work=` | branch | commit 1 | commit 2 | PR title |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `bug` | `agent/fix-<issue>-<slug>` | `test(<scope>): reproduce <issue> (#<N>)` | `fix(<scope>): …` | `fix(<scope>): …` |
| `extension` / `feature` | `agent/feat-<issue>-<slug>` | `test(<scope>): specify <what> (#<N>)` | `feat(<scope>): …` | `feat(<scope>): …` |

For the additive row, **commit 1 may legitimately fail to compile**, because the API it calls
does not exist yet. That is still a red that turns green and it still proves the test
exercises the new code rather than restating it — but say so explicitly in the body, because
an unexplained compile error reads as a broken PR and a reviewer who assumes that will close
it.

Everything else — the classes, the required sections, the excluded areas — is
identical. Pick the row from `work=`, not from the issue's label.

The test must exercise the code it guards — call the changed module, do not rebuild the
behaviour inline — and it must fail if the fix is reverted. If you cannot write such a test,
say so in the PR body in those words and explain why a real guard is not feasible. Do not
ship a test that hardcodes the fixed path and call it a regression test.

If the test needs a GStreamer element, check the package list in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
A test that skips on a missing element passes green and guards nothing, so add the package in
the same PR or pick a different approach.

Then establish what you can actually verify. Try `cargo --version` and
`pkg-config --modversion gstreamer-1.0`:

- **If you can build:** run the tests at both commits and paste the real output — the failure
  at commit 1 and the pass at commit 2. Build from the workspace root, never with `-p`.
- **If you cannot build:** say that plainly once, and give the maintainer the two commands
  that reproduce the before and after locally.

Expect a formatting round trip. Without `cargo` you cannot run `cargo fmt`, and CI's
`Check formatting` step is unforgiving — match the surrounding style closely, and when that
check is the only thing red, fix it and **force-push, keeping exactly the two commits**.
Never add a third commit to repair a mechanical check.

Push commit 1, open the PR, then push commit 2. CI has no concurrency group, so both
runs complete and both appear on the PR: the first is the deliberate failure, the second is
the state you are proposing. Record both run URLs in the body; Phase 1 of a later run fills
in their conclusions.

## The PR

**Ready for review, never a draft.** You stop when the work is finished, so the PR opens
finished. The verdict line already carries whether the evidence has arrived; a draft flag
would say it a second time, and less precisely. Title `fix(<scope>): <what it does>`,
prefixed `[needs hardware]` when class B applies for want of a device rather than for want
of time.

- **Class A — verified.** You are holding execution evidence right now: test output you
  produced in this run, or two concluded CI runs showing commit 1 red and commit 2 green.
  The maintainer's job is to read the diff, not to reproduce anything.
- **Class B — proposal, not verified.** The evidence has not arrived yet, or cannot be
  produced here at all (no device, browser, GPU or network).
- **Class C — blocked on a dispatch.** The evidence exists and is one human command away:
  the covering check is a macOS or Windows build this repo does not run on a pull request by
  default. C is exempt from the 14-day stale closure. State the exact command in the body.

**A newly opened PR is therefore almost always class B**, because you open it before CI can
have concluded — or class C, when the covering check is a platform build only a human can
fire. Phase 1 of a later run promotes it. Never reason "the mechanism is obviously right, so
this is A": certainty is not evidence.

Required sections, in this order, omitting any with nothing to say:

1. **Verdict line.** One of:
   `Class A — the test below fails without this fix.`
   `Class B — proposal, not verified: <why>.`
   `Class C — blocked on a dispatch: <the command>.`
   Then `Fixes #<N>` for class A, `Refs #<N>` for B and C — work whose evidence has not
   arrived must not auto-close the issue.
2. **Problem.** The mechanism, cited.
3. **Change.** What you did and why this approach. The repo keeps no internals docs, so the
   PR trail is the design record. Name the alternative the triage stage rejected.
4. **Evidence.** Class A: the two commands and their real output, or the two CI run URLs with
   the deliberate first failure explained. Class B: what the argument rests on, and then, as
   its own paragraph, **How to falsify this** — the exact thing to run or watch, and which
   result means the hypothesis is wrong. *A proposal without a falsification test is an
   opinion and must not be opened as a PR.*
5. **Not verified.** Everything you did not run: platforms, other codecs and pipeline shapes,
   the zero/one/many cases, native versus WASM. State it even when the list is long — the
   maintainer scaling the work down is their call, not yours.
6. **Blast radius.** What else calls the changed symbol (grep and read at least one call
   site), and which configurations other than the reporter's change behaviour.

### Size the body before you write it

**At most 3500 characters**, checked with
`scripts/agent/verify-citations.sh --max-chars 3500 <file>`. Aim at 3000, and write to this
allocation so the first draft is already the right size:

| | Verdict | Problem | Change | Evidence | Not verified | Blast radius |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Characters | 150 | 700 | 800 | 800 | 350 | 500 |

Per-section ceilings; a section with nothing to say is still omitted. Problem, Change and
Evidence are the design record and are worth their length — cut anything the diff already says.

Over the ceiling means **one section is over its allocation.** Rewrite that section against
its number; do not reword across the whole body to recover a few dozen characters. Two checks
is the budget. Still over after the second: cut Not verified to one sentence naming the
categories, and Blast radius to the one call site you read.

Then comment once on the issue linking the PR and naming its class. **Do not restate the
body** — link it. That comment is read alongside the PR, not instead of it.

## Before you publish, confirm

- `verify-citations.sh` exits zero on the body, if the body cites code.
- The branch has exactly the two commits, in that order.
- The PR is ready for review, not a draft.
- The class matches evidence you can point at. If you did not run the test yourself and CI
  has not concluded, it is B, and the body says `Refs`, not `Fixes`. The issue comment and
  the run summary repeat whatever class the body claims, so a premature A propagates to three
  places at once.
- Nothing in the diff touches an excluded area that the answer did not explicitly name.
  If an override authorised one, the body quotes the line that granted it.
- No emojis in log macros. Everything in English.
